// Imperative vs Declarative

for(let i = 0; i < 1000; i++){ // This is pretty imperative, you tell need to less than 1000, need plus one every loop
    console.log(i)
}

[1,2,3].forEach(item => console.log(item)) // more declarative, we are like telling website what to do, rather than giving machine type instruction
